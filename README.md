# OpenMP/MPI

Implement the **k-means clustering algorithm** in OpenMP/MPI, trying to maximize the performance (reduce the execution time) by carefully exploiting the resources within one computing node with multiple processing cores (OpenMP) and across computing nodes (MPI).

> **Optional:** implement the same algorithm in Apache Flink and compare the performance of the two implementations (processing time and scalability) under various workloads.
